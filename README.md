# Description<br>
mnl ( multithreaded-networking-library ) is a tool to rapidly develop applications using c , the Berkley socket library and POSIX pthreads. The library will be extensively tested.

To use the code run make inside of mnl. It will generate a mnl.a file which you can copy to your project directory. To compile simply do

````bash
gcc main.c mnl.a
````

I will manually generate the single header for the library everytime.
